TUI Password Manager Design Doc
By Harry Phillips

General Description:
A terminal based password manager, accessible through a terminal user interface (TUI). This is a local only password manager, with support for multiple users with each user having their own unique file.
Each file will include information about the site, usernames, passwords, supplementary notes and metadata about that entry. Encryption should be industry standard, including argon2 for password hashing,
and keep a unique MAC information for file tampering. Additional there should be support for auto generation of new passwords and the ability to parse existing passwords from Bitwarden into this program.
This will all be handled in the backend, with the front-end displaying both a login screen, setup-screen for porting existing passwords from Bitwarden and a split-screen password viewer, with auto logout
functionality.
