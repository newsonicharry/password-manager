TUI Password Manager Design Doc
By Harry Phillips

General Description:
A terminal based password manager, accessible through a terminal user interface (TUI). This is a local only password manager, with support for multiple
users with each user having their own unique file. Each file will include information about the site, usernames, passwords, supplementary notes and metadata
about that entry. Encryption should be industry standard, including argon2 for password hashing, and keep a unique MAC information for file tampering.
Additional there should be support for auto generation of new passwords and the ability to parse existing passwords from Bitwarden into this program.
This will all be handled in the backend, with the front-end displaying both a login screen, setup-screen for porting existing passwords from Bitwarden
and a split-screen password viewer, with auto logout functionality.

Dependencies:
-libsodium
-FTXUI

Encryption Architecture:
(WIP)

TUI Interface:
-First time screen (if no files exist)
	-Displays the username and password
	-Has checkbox and path to use bitwarden import
	-Has argon2 parameters, (memory, iterations)
	-Create vault button

-Login screen
	-Username field
	-Password field
	-Enter and Quit button
	-Also has a status info at the bottom

-Main Vault
	- Left side has entires list
	- Right side has site information, username info, notes, some meta info such as date modified and a hidden password
	- There are then four options on the right bottom
		- [r] reveal password
		- [c] copy password
		- [e] edit entry
		- [d] delete entry
	- New entries includes those fields, plus a password generator
	- at the bottom there are several other options
		- [/] search
		- [n] new
		- [q] logout  
	- This main vault will automatically logout after 15 minutes


Internal Design (WIP, may change):
	Class Vault{};
	-Holds Password entries and handles adding / editing entries

	Struct PasswordEntry{};
	Sturct EntryMetadata{};

	Class VaultService{};
	-Handles the creation and opening of a vault

	Class SessionManager{};
	-Handles inactivity

	Class CryptoEngine{};
	-Encrypts, decryptes and handles the MAC

	Class BitwardedImporter{};
	-Open the Bitwarden json
	
	Class SecureString{};
	-All passwords and other important data is held in here and gets zeroed-out

	Class VaultView{};
	-What FTXUI actually interacts with
